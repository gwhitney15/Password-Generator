Attempted to make the password generator. This project is uncomplete. Due to the holiday weekend, I was unable to find time to recieve tutoring on this. I intend to recieve tutoring on this assignment to further alter it and learn from what I have done wrong this week.

This project is used to collect information on certain critera when the generate password button is clicked and output a randomly generated password.

Added prompts to collect how long the password should be as well as used confirms to include certain password criteria.

When prompts are selected, the console logs a string of all selected criteria. I attempted and failed to add a functioning way to randomize a password of appropriate length from this generated string. I was unsure of how to make this work and intend to recieve tutoring on this part of the assignment.
